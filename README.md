# DataProductsWeek4

This repository contains the result of the work done for the Coursera course: Developing Data Products,
Weeks 4 Assignment.

## Tasks
This peer assessed assignment has two parts. 
1. Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. 
2. Use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.


The application must include the following:

1. Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
2. Some operation on the ui input in sever.R
3. Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
4. You must also include enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.

The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself..

## Solution
We choose to write an application displaying world population evolution since 1950.
The source data is taken from [worldometers]
